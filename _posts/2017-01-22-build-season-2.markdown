Greetings my aquatic mammals of action!

With Week Two behind our tails and Week Three approaching over the ocean line, we’re well on our way to having a final design solidified. Designs for the climber, the shooter, and the gear mechanism are all solid and their respective prototypes are almost foolproof. Combined with an estimated 120 ball capacity, we’re looking at a really solid robot this year!

### Reminders:

#### Team Calendar + Finals Schedule
Remember you can find all meeting dates and times on our [team calendar](/students/calendar/). This week, as you’ve probably already taken note of (or should have), is finals week. In order to allow students to diligently focus on their academics, we will not be having meetings this Wednesday, 1/25, and Thursday, 1/26. Friday’s meeting will also start at 1:00pm and end at 5:30pm to accommodate the half-day schedule. Meetings on Monday and Tuesday will still be held as usual. Next Monday and Tuesday, however are Teacher Inservice days, so meetings will be held from 10:00am to 4:00pm. Good luck on all of your finals!

#### Remember to Keep Signing In/Out
Even if you’re not part of the competition team, workshop hours still do count and are used to determine eligibility for leadership positions. Please remember to sign in and out every meeting. If you do end up forgetting, fill out a [Time Log Worksheet](/assets/documents/FRC_Time_Log_Workshop.pdf) and get it signed by a mentor so we know you’re doing something and not just watching the 3D printer do its thing.

#### Subteam Updates:

**Mechanical:** *(drafted by Christian C.)*  
“This week has been a bit slow for mechanical due to many people being sick and prototyping slowing down.  Not much has been going on other than CAD, but CAD is almost complete with just a few details needing to be added here and there. We are a little behind, but everything is starting to catch back up.”

**Controls:** *(developed by Jamie S.)*  
“This week in controls, we continued helping Mechanical prototype components for the robot. With the installation of a 3:1 gearbox on the new shooter prototype, we can now control its speed precisely using a feedback loop. We were able to score balls with 2/3 accuracy using this setup, and we might be able to increase that even further on the actual robot since it has tighter tolerances. We also organized all of the robot electronics parts into bins on the parts array.  Lastly, the attendance scanner broke on Wednesday this week because someone yanked on the cord and damaged the power port on the Raspberry Pi. It's been patched for now with a liberal application of VHB tape, but please be careful with it in the future.”


Not as much reading as last week is it? Again, if you ever so happen to have any questions that remain unanswered, please do feel free to shoot me an email - I'm always open. That’s all for this week my friends; good luck on finals and remember to order those T-shirts! Here’s your weekly quotation to toss around in your head:

“Let us make our future now, and let us make our dreams tomorrow’s reality.”  
  - Malala Yousafzai

Any day is a day for success, but you just need to add that pinch of aspiration. Don’t be afraid to chase those dreams.

P.S.  One of our CCA FIRST alumnus, Elan Adler, has already been chasing his dream, and has recently led this [pretty cool little project](http://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2016/1/13/aio-robotics-breakthrough-idea-for-educational-3d-printing).
