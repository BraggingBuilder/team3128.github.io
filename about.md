Team 3128 Aluminum Narwhals is a high school robotics team at Canyon Crest Academy in San Diego, California. We are currently in the off competition season, and prepping for an exciting 2015-2016 year.

Our team was founded in September of 2009 at Canyon Crest Academy in San Diego, California, at a school where math, science, and technology were valued, but hadn’t found a way to be manifested yet. A handful of students, one engineering mentor, and a computer programming teacher felt those values were important – and thus the Aluminum Narwhals were born.

Our robotics team, along with several others found at our school, participates in a non-profit program known as FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) in the high school division known as FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) as well as another division known as FTC (First Tech Challenge). Founded in 1992 by inventor Dean Kamen, FIRST has quickly grown to be a worldwide, prestigious, competitive robotics experience for all ages. Between the elementary level FIRST Lego League division (FLL), FTC and FRC, thousands of students and adults participate in competitions across the globe each year, culminating in a large championship competition currently held in St. Louis, Missouri.

*“Our mission is to provide a positive high school team experience through robotics while inspiring intellectual creativity, fostering a passion for science, technology, and engineering, and developing critical thinking, problem solving and team building skills.”*
