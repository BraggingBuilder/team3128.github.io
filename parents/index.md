### Welcome Parents

CCA is one of the best campsuses around, for its stellar academics, sports, arts - not to mention its amazing FRC team. To become involved with the Aluminium Narwhals, all you need is to have a child attending CCA. Here, you can find important dates, frequently asked questions, and information on how to help out by volunteering, mentoring, or donating.
