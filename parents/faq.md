## Frequently Asked Questions

Have a question about our robotics program? Here are some of the most often asked questions and our answers to them. If your question is not listed, feel free to shoot us an [email](/contact/).

**When does the team meet during the week?**

Our team meets on Wednesdays and Fridays from 3:00 pm – 6:00 pm every week of the school year. The workshop is also open for optional workshop time on Mondays 3:00 pm – 5:00 pm if students want to work on projects. You can look at [our calendar]() for details.

During build season (January/February) we meet Monday – Saturday on most weeks. Check out our [build season](/students/build-seasons/) page for more information.

**Where do you guys meet?**

We meet in the Robotics Workshop, which is next to the Nest under the Media Center. It is a part of the Administration building.

**Is it mandatory that I be at every meeting?**

Our team is open to students with a variety of time commitments, and we do not ‘cut’ team members if they can’t come very often. However, there are hour requirements for various privileges such as: joining the leadership team, travel team, or being selected for a competition position. These commitments usually need a 50 – 80% attendance record, excluding optional days.

Students with limited time must be aware of their availability and act accordingly. Getting involved in build project groups or leadership positions where you hold a key position might not be the wisest decision if you have other responsibilities. However, don’t let that stop you from getting involved at all.

**Is it mandatory that I stay for the entire meeting?**

Students can come and leave as they like from each meeting. They should make sure to sign in and out with our Workshop Supervisor so that their hours are properly logged. However, most of the time announcements, project logistics, etc, will all happen at the beginning of the meeting. So, if you get their late make sure to talk to a mentor or student to find out what is happening.

If you need to leave early, make sure the people you are working with are aware of your departure time. That way all of you can work together to figure out when clean up needs to happen, future plans, etc.

**I have a fall sport. Can I be involved?**

Students involved in seasonal sports can still be involved during their off-season. For instance, if you are a member of a fall sport which usually ends October/November, you can definitely hop in. Just make sure that you’ve finished our [Getting Started checklist](/students/).

A good rule of thumb is that our most busy time is from November – March. If you sport doesn’t overlap with those months, you definitely can be involved during our main competition season.

**I have a sport during competition season. Can I get involved during Fall/Spring?**

If you really can’t be a part of the team during the main competition season, you are still welcome to join us during our off-season. We usually have build projects going and different workshops that can teach you valuable information about all sorts of mechanical, electrical, programming, or construction-related skills.

**Who goes to your competitions? What are competition positions? Who are they open to?**

Our competition team is made up of the students selected for competition positions. These are different roles that students can interview/audition for if they have met the position requirements. While all students are allowed to join us for our tournaments and help us compete, our competition team have very specific positions that are vital to our success.

Auditions/interviews for the competition team is held at the beginning of February during build season. You can view the requirements for each position [here]().

Parents and students not on our competition team are invited to join us at the competition. It is a great opportunity to meet other teams, get inspired by robots, and get to know the rest of your team better.
