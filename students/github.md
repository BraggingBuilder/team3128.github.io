# GitHub

[GitHub](http://github.com) is the place where all team information, discussion, and collaboration will occur in the future. Any information that the team needs to know can be found on our organization's GitHub, as well as new projects and code.

Team 3128 has an organization GitHub account, which allows all of the members and mentors to collaborate and view all shared repositories.
